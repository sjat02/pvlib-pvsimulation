== Introduction

The Energy Management System (EMS) is a software solution designed to monitor and control energy production, storage, and consumption in a hybrid energy system. It focuses on optimizing the performance and efficiency of **Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)** and **Photovoltaic (PV) systems**.


== System Architecture

The EMS architecture consists of several components working together:

- **WAGO Edge Controller**: The central controller for monitoring and controlling energy systems.
- **BESS (Battery Energy Storage System)**: Storage units for managing energy consumption.
- **SMA Inverters**: Devices that convert DC power from PV panels to AC power.
- **Janitza Meter**: For measuring power consumption and generation.

Include a diagram of the system architecture.


== Functional Description

The EMS receives power setpoints from KÃœS/EZA and dispatches power to 9 battery containers for efficient energy storage and consumption. The system optimizes battery life during charge and discharge cycles to maximize system longevity.

The EMS also communicates with the **SMA inverters** to manage energy flow between the storage and grid, ensuring a balanced energy output.


== Deployment & Configuration

To deploy the EMS, follow these steps:

1. Set up the WAGO Edge Controller.
2. Configure the communication between the EMS and the **SMA inverters**.
3. Use Docker for deploying the EMS software.
4. Adjust configuration files for specific set points and energy management parameters.


== Troubleshooting & Maintenance

If the EMS stops responding, ensure the WAGO Edge Controller is connected properly. In case of power dispatch failures, verify the communication with SMA inverters.

For system monitoring, regularly check the logs in `/var/log/ems/`.
